\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}
I am submitting an application for the Engineering Instructional Support Tutor position. I was informed about this position by Dr. Carol Hulls, and am very interested in the position. \\

I am a fourth year Mechatronics Engineering student, graduating this year. I have worked as a WEEF Teaching Assistant for the GENE 121 course twice on co-op terms, and found that to be very enjoyable. As a student at the University of Waterloo, I have participated in many activities to help first year students, including resume critiques run by the Engineering Society, and being an orientation week leader. \\

I look forward to hearing from you about this oppurtunity. I can be reached via e-mail at sbkraeme@uwaterloo.ca, or by phone at 226-606-4052. \\

Thank you for your time.
\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
